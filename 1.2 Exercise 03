The Bokeh ColumnDataSource (continued)
You can create a ColumnDataSource object directly from a Pandas DataFrame by passing the DataFrame to the class initializer.

In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and read in a data set containing all Olympic medals awarded in the 100 meter sprint from 1896 to 2012. A color column has been added indicating the CSS colorname we wish to use in the plot for every data point.

Your job is to import the ColumnDataSource class, create a new ColumnDataSource object from the DataFrame df, and plot circle glyphs with 'Year' on the x-axis and 'Time' on the y-axis. Color each glyph by the color column.

The figure object p has already been created for you.
# Import the ColumnDataSource class from bokeh.plotting
from bokeh.plotting import ColumnDataSource

# Create a ColumnDataSource from df: source
source = ColumnDataSource(df)

# Add circle glyphs to the figure p
p.circle(x= 'Year',y= 'Time', source=source, color=df['color'], size=8)

# Specify the name of the output file and show the result
output_file('sprint.html')
show(p)
