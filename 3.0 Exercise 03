Add a single slider
In the previous exercise, you added a single plot to the "current document" of your application. In this exercise, you'll practice adding a layout to your current document.

Your job here is to create a single slider, use it to create a widgetbox layout, and then add this layout to the current document.

The slider you create here cannot be used for much, but in the later exercises, you'll use it to update your plots!
