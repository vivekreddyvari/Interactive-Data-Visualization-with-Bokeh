Multiple sliders in one document
Having added a single slider in a widgetbox layout to your current document, you'll now add multiple sliders into the current document.

Your job in this exercise is to create two sliders, add them to a widgetbox layout, and then add the layout into the current document.

# Perform necessary imports
from bokeh.io import curdoc
from bokeh.layouts import widgetbox
from bokeh.models import Slider

# Create first slider: slider1
slider1 = Slider(title='slider1', start=0, end=10, step=0.1, value=2)

# Create second slider: slider2
slider2 = Slider(title='slider2', start=10, end=100, step=1, value=20)

# Add slider1 and slider2 to a widgetbox
layout = widgetbox(slider1, slider2)

# Add the layout to the current document
curdoc().add_root(layout)
